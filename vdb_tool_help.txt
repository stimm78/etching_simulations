This command-line tool can perform a use-defined, and possibly
non-linear, sequence of high-level tasks available in openvdb.
For instance, it can convert polygon meshes and particles to level
sets, and subsequently perform a large number of operations on these
level set surfaces. It can also generate adaptive polygon meshes from
level sets, write them to disk and even render them to image files.

Note that actions always start with one or more "-", and (except for file names)
its options always contain a "=" and an optional number of characters
used for identification, e.g. "-erode r=2" is identical to "-erode radius=2.0"
but "-erode rr=2" will produce an error since "rr" does not match
the first two character of "radius". Also note that this tool maintains two
lists of primitives, namely geometry (i.e. points and meshes) and level sets.
They can be referenced with "geo=n" and "vdb=n" where the integer "n" refers
to age (i.e stack index) of the primitive with "n=0" meaning most recent. E.g.
-mesh2ls g=1" means convert the second to last geometry (here polygon mesh) to a
level set. Likewise "-gauss v=0" means perform a gaussian filter on the most
recent level set (default).
